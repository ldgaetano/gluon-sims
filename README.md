# Gluon Stablecoin Protocol Simulations

Simulation environment for testing and validating Gluon Z Reactor mechanics using the `pygluon` library.

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for simulating the different variants of the Gluon stablecoin protocol. The main purpose of the simulation is testing different theorems and improve ours understanding of how the system behaves.

## Setup
